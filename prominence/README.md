# Prominence
Set of tools to help identify people holding prominent roles within organisations.
Started in June 2025.

## List of files
* [list of prominent functions](list_of_prominent_functions.yaml) — a list of senior job/role titles such as Director, Trustee, Chief Financial Officer. Also, includes some industry specific terms such as Chief Constable.
* [stop list](prominence_stop_list.yaml) — a list of words and phrases to remove in clean up (e.g. acting, full-time).
* [symbols](prominence_symbols.yaml) — supports normalisation of language, deals with abbreviations and variants

## Limitations
* Only includes English terms and a very small number of French terms at present.
* There are inherent difficulties in identofying senior role titles. Titles such as "Head of" could be very senior in one organisation but more junior in another.
* At present, the tools are limited to YAML files containing lists and there is no code to check role
